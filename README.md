## Project Overview

This project is a **web-based tour vehicle booking system** developed for *Ceylon Best Tours*.
The system allows tourists to **plan and book trips easily**, while enabling the business owner to **manage bookings, packages, costs, and reports digitally**.

The system supports:

1. **Custom trip planning** (user-defined trips)
2. **Pre-defined tour packages**

Vehicles are provided **with drivers**, but the driver is **not a system user**.
All costs and expenses are **calculated automatically during booking**.

---

## User Roles

The system has **two main user roles**:

### Customer (Tourist)

* Register & log in
* Plan **custom trips** (number of days, destinations, adults, children)
* Book **pre-defined tour packages**
* View booking history
* View total trip cost before confirmation

### Admin

* Log in securely
* Manage customers
* Create, update, and delete tour packages
* Manage vehicles and pricing
* View all bookings (custom & package)
* View system-generated expenses and income
* Generate reports (bookings, revenue, profit)

---

## Expense Handling (Updated Design)

* Expenses are **automatically generated at booking time**
* No separate driver expense entry (fuel, parking, etc.)
* Trip cost includes:

  * vehicle cost
  * driver service
  * distance / duration factors
* This simplifies the system and improves automation

---

## Key Features

* Role-based authentication (Admin & Customer)
* Custom trip planner with automatic cost calculation
* Tour package booking system
* Vehicle-with-driver concept
* Admin dashboard with reports
* Responsive and user-friendly UI
